Because the seating folds back, the space is sufficiently flexible to accommodate theatre in the round, more intimate musical events or fitness-related and dance activities. It is heated and well lit, with disabled access catered for – a beautiful setting for any event.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">Click here to see a 4D virtual tour of our theatre.</span></p>',
