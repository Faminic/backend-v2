# PVCC website - User Manual
# General
## Activities
Activities (e.g. Fast Feet Football Academy) are not bookable online. 
To make an enquiry about an activity, a user can email PVCC via the 
Contact-Us page.

## Facilities
Most facilities are bookable online. When a user navigates to the PVCC booking form, they
will be able to select a facility, duration and date, and a list of available times will 
automatically be generated for them.

The user can then select a time and pay for their booking via Paypal. When the payment has been confirmed, 
they receive a payment summary, and a reservation will be created in the PVCC database. PVCC receives an email with the booking details, including name, phone number and the Paypal payment ID.

# Administrator
## Editing Basic Content
Basic (static) content can be edited via the **main admin page**.

To log in, navigate to **[site name]/admin**, and enter the admin login details.

## More Complex Editing
Adding, editing and deleting venues involves making changes to the site's database. As such, these tasks require the use
of the **booking-admin page**.

To log in, navigate to **[site name]/booking-admin**, and enter the admin login details.

#### Venues
'Venues' is the name given to facilities. A venue contains rooms and products.

The admin can choose whether to make a venue bookable online or not. For instance, if booking for the theatre should
only be done by emailing or calling PVCC, the 'theatre' venue would not need to be bookable online, and its 'bookable' property should be unchecked.

#### Rooms
'Rooms' are the sections into which a venue can be divided. They can be added and deleted by the administrator.

#### Products
Products are the things that users can book and pay for. They can contain multiple rooms, and make it possible for a user to book portions of a venue (e.g. two courts of the Sports Hall). A product also has hourly, half-day and day prices (shown in pounds).

Products can be added, deleted, and edited.

#### Reservations
Each product has an associated list of reservations. Reservations are bookings for a product which have been made online, and can be viewed, added and deleted.

# FAQ
**How do I issue a refund to a customer?**

Payments can be refunded on the Paypal website. To refund a payment, the payment ID is required. 

You can find this from the booking-admin page. Select the venue, view the list of reservations for the product booked, and look for the reservation you need to refund, which contains the payment ID. Once the refund has been made, delete the reservation.

**A new facility has been built, and I want to add it to the website. How do I do this?**
- Go to the 'booking-admin' page, log in, then add the venue, with the relevant rooms and products.
- Log in to the main admin page, select 'Facility' and then click 'Add page'.
- Add the page name, and below this a description of the new facility.
- Add a banner image, thumbnail and any extra images. You can do this via a simple 'drag and drop' method, or by copy-pasting them.
- Add opening times for the facility, then click 'Publish' to publish them to the website, or 'Temp' to preview.
- Add a link to the new facility on the 'whats-on' page if necessary.

The new facility will now have its own page on the website, and the site's users will be able to book and pay for it online.
