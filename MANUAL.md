# PVCC website - User Manual
# User Perspective
## Activities
Activities (e.g. Fast Feet Football Academy) are not bookable online. 
To make an enquiry about an activity, a user can email PVCC via the 
Contact-Us page, which they are directed towards.

## Facilities

#### User bookings
Most facilities are bookable online. When a user navigates to the PVCC booking form, they
will be able to select a facility, duration and date, and a list of available times will 
automatically be generated for them.

The user can then select a time and pay for their booking via Paypal. When the payment has been confirmed, 
they receive a payment summary, and a reservation will be created in the PVCC database.

# Administrator Perspective
## Editing Static Content
Static content can be edited via the main admin page.

To log in, navigate to [site name]/admin, and enter the admin login details.

This page is designed to be intuitive and easy-to-use.

## More Complex Editing
Adding, editing and deleting venues involves making changes to the site's database. As such, these tasks require the use
of the booking-admin page.

To log in, navigate to [site name]/booking-admin, and enter the admin login details.

#### Venues
'Venues' is the name given to facilities.

#### Rooms
Each venue can be divided into rooms.

#### Products
Products can contain multiple rooms.

#### Reservations (bookings)
Each venue's product has an associated list of reservations, which can be viewed and changed.
